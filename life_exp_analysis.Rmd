```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r }
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
data("gapminder_unfiltered")
```
This is my random comment. But it doesn't mean anything. 
```{r }
sumdata <- gapminder_unfiltered %>% 
  group_by(year)%>% 
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(year, country, lifeExp) %>%
  arrange(year)
```

Another random comment.
